- 👋 Hi, I’m Cari (@C_Hyde_V)
- 👀 I’m interested in applications of AI/machine-learning to assist or replace judicial decision-making, and how that might affect the legitimacy of the justice system as a whole.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NLP in python and to improve my data-science skills in R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate!
- 📫 How to reach me ... LinkedIn or Twitter @C_Hyde_V
